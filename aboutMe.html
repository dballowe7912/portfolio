            <p>I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas and have lived and traveled all over the United States
            working various jobs. I'm a jack of all trades, yet didn't discover my true passion in life 
            until I started building websites. For the last year I have spent all my free time have learning and practicing 
            web development. Becoming a full time freelance web developer is a dream I am making a reality. The main two reasons to work
            with me are split between my determination, to go above and beyond to meet goals in a timely manner, and my reliabilty to 
            deliver a quality product.</p>
